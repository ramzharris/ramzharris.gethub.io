            <h2>Hick's Law: Keeping Things Simple</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></h3>
            <p>
                It is probably common knowledge that Google’s homepage is one of the simplest webpages out there for
                the desktop version with placing their logo high and centered, with their search bar. Very few
                functions, very simple, and where the mobile page differs is, they add items below the search bar that
                you may be interested in. These items can range from anywhere between ads for a product, to new articles
                covering what they believe interests you. Here you can see from this screenshot that they still keep
                this homepage simple, and do not over burden you with too much to do. This is probably one of the
                biggest websites that practices Hick’s Law.

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy: Grabbing Your Attention</h2>
        <h3>Matti Haapoja</h3>
        <p>
            When visiting Matti’s website, the first thing that stands out is a stunning picture with some
            motivational words centered. This image stands out on the page because below it is mostly white, so your
            eyes are drawn to it. Then the scene is interesting, peaking the viewers interest even more. And from the
            use of a beautiful image displayed as a focal point there is interest to see what is below.
